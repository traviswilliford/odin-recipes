        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>A meal that even you could make. I mean come on, its chicken in a pan
                with some vegetables around it. How hard could it be? Just make sure
                that you fully cook the chicken and really no one can complain. It 
                could taste like the bottom of your shoe and no one would complain so
                long as it doesn't give them salmonella. Give them salmonella, however,
                and they may want to have a word with the chef. Oh also, potatoes.
