The recipe html webpage project

In this project, I will be using my knowledge so far to create an html 
site that has multiple links. I am assuming that it will use my current 
understanding of formatting text and paragraphs and headers, as well as 
my ability to create links to other pages, external websites, and images.
I am comfortable with these skills so far, and I am hoping that will lead
to smooth completion of this assignment.
